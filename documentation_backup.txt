Documentation

One to four sentences explaining what your project is and what it does:
•	Our project is one that asks the user for two cities in the United States (cities in all 50 states are supported, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico are also supported) and provides them with a detailed weather report that includes information about both cities and important insights/highlights about the weather data. It uses OpenWeatherMap's "Current weather data" API to do so.

An explanation on how to run the program from the command line:
•	First, run without debugging in Visual Studio Code, then you will be prompted to enter the name of the first city you'd like to know the weather for. After you enter the name of the first city, you will be prompted to enter the abbreviation of the state the city is located in. For example, you would first enter Baltimore, and then MD. After entering the state abbreviation, you will then be prompted to enter the name of the second city you'd like to know the weather for. After you enter the name of the second city, you will be prompted to enter the abbreviation of the state the city is located in. Then the program will automatically display a weather report using both cities.

Documentation on how to use the program / how to interpret the output of the program:
•	The weather report tells you what you're looking at. It tells you the following weather information about a city:
-Current Temperature in Fahrenheit
-Feels Like Temperature in Fahrenheit
-Max Temperature in Fahrenheit
-Min Temperature in Fahrenheit
-Air Pressure in inches of mercury (inHg)
-Humidity Percentage
-Cloudiness Percentage
-Wind Speed in miles per hour
-Wind Direction in degrees and cardinal direction
-Visibility in miles
•	It also has an insight and highlight section that tells you the following information:

-Whether the first city is hotter, colder or the same current temperature as the second city
-A guess of how the weather feels like in the city
-Whether the city has a dangerous feels like temperature or not
-Whether the city has very low visibility that could cause difficulty driving or not
