Create a software application that tells the user about the weather in a certain city just by
using that cityâ€™s name. We want to make it easier to view the weather without having to
search it up all the time or constantly having to open a weather app. We plan to do this
by utilizing OpenWeatherMap, an API that gives real time weather data (OpenWeather,
n.d.). Weather apps often have too many aspects and features that contribute to a user
feeling overwhelmed on how to interpret what the weather is like and also difficulty in
preparing for the weather that day. In order to combat and address those issues, our
project wants to simplify weather apps and just give users what they are looking for.
